# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Quad Pong

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

I will create a game a pong that can be played by four people, using a single keyboard.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My software will intergrate the basics of a two player pong game and expand that to allow four players to battle it out to be pong master. Instead of having two sides bounce a ball back and forth there will be a left and right player along with one at the top and one at the bottom. In a sense its kinda like two different games of pong going on with one instance where both sides are messing with the position of the ball. The program will have a turtle ball that will be detected as it moves through out the space to see if it goes out of bounds (which will score a point to the respective side.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

Good outcome getting four players to play the game.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Getting the detection system for points to work properly with four players.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Having the game work without a problem.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

Some skills that I might need to learn about is how to properly create a trackable object within the given bounds and having it reset once it goes out of bounds whoch signals a goal. I will probably research example games of pong to see how one implaments the game with other aspects such as faster balls or more then one ball, this will give me a better understanding of how to expand to four players.
