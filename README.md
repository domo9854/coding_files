"""
Controls: [RED: W S ] [BLUE: UP DOWN] [PURPLE: NUM 1 NUM 2 ] [GREEN: G H ] ~~~ make sure caps lock is off ~~~
Rules: 
        1. This is kind of like a unfair game of pong, you play for yourself but must watch for others because you only score on the opposite of your position
        so it might be worth to think when you want to let the ball pass and when you wanna bounce it back. 
        2. There is no score limit you can go for as long as you want do not stress over who wins it will take the focus away from the game.

Overall creating the basic two player pong was simple because of all the helpful guides out there, but the problem that I came across when making my quad pong
was detecting the other two paddles, after some messing with the numbers and directional parts I managed to figure out the problem and made it work right after 
fixing it.
